## Outline

The reference of all:

1. Environment variables docker/sdk provides, possible values and the source of them (deploy.yml, autogenerated, infrastructure).
2. Pipelines and how docker/sdk refer to them.
3. Console commands docker/sdk runs.
4. Other connections between project and docker/sdk (to investigate).

N.B. I need to see the mapping: what environment variables for what application.
