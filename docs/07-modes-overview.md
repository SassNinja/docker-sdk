## Outline

1. [Port the existing document]
2. Emphasize that demo mode is closer to production one, so it is better to use for QA and demo.
3. Dev mode is better to use when changes in the codebase must be seen instantly.
4. Describe a case when changes in demo mode can be seen in 2 minutes using docker/sdk up. (You would not need dev mode if you need to make small changes once).
